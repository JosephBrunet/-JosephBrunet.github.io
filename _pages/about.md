Hi, I'm Joseph Brunet, a PhD student in biomechanics at <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/" target="\_blank">École des Mines de Saint-Étienne</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in biomedical engineering and cardiovascular diseases.
I'm part of the <a href="https://www.emse.fr/~badel/Pierre_Badel___Soft_tissue_biomechanics/AArteMIS.html" target="\_blank">AArteMIS project</a>. My work consits in obtaining and analyzing data from in situ mechanical testing of arteries in an X-ray micro-tomography environment. In particular, I investigate the mechanisms of aortic dissection.
