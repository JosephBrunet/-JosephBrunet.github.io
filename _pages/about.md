Hi, my name is Joseph Brunet.  
I'm currently a PhD student in biomechanics at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne working on the <a href="https://www.emse.fr/~badel/Pierre_Badel___Soft_tissue_biomechanics/AArteMIS.html" target="\_blank">AArteMIS project</a>. I work on obtaining and analyzing data from in situ mechanical testing of arteries in an X-ray micro-tomography environment. In particular, I investigate the mechanisms of medial dissection.
