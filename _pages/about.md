#Hi, I'm Joseph Brunet, <br>
##a PhD student in biomechanics at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne. <br>

<p class="archive_text">
I'm part of the <a href="https://www.emse.fr/~badel/Pierre_Badel___Soft_tissue_biomechanics/AArteMIS.html" target="\_blank">AArteMIS project</a>. My work consits of obtaining and analyzing data from in situ mechanical testing of arteries in an X-ray micro-tomography environment. In particular, I investigate the mechanisms of aortic dissection.
