<p class="archive_text">Hi, my name is Joseph Brunet. <br> 
I'm currently a PhD student in biomechanics at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne working on the
<a href="https://www.emse.fr/~badel/Pierre_Badel___Soft_tissue_biomechanics/AArteMIS.html" target="\_blank">AArteMIS project</a>. I work on obtaining and analyzing data from in situ mechanical testing of arteries in an X-ray micro-tomography environment. In particular, I investigate the mechanisms of medial dissection.</p>
